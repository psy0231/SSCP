# 2. A Telnet Example
> Keywords: Telnet, Console Project, References

## Create a Console project and add references of SuperSocket
1. Create a "Console Application" project. After the project is created, you should change the target framework of this project from "Client Profile" to a full framework. Because this application will run as server and the SuperSocket is not compiled with "Client Profile".
2. Add SuperSocket's dll (SuperSocket.Common.dll, SuperSocket.SocketBase.dll, SuperSocket.SocketEngine.dll) in this project's reference
3. Add log4net.dll in this project's reference, because SuerSocket uses it as default logging framework
4. Include log4net.config which is provided by SuperSocket in the project folder "Config" and set it's Build Action to be "Content" and Copy to Output Directory to be "Copy if newer", because log4net require it

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerryjiang/SuperSocket.Document/v1.6/images/telnetproject.jpg)

## Write the Start/Stop Server Code

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Console.WriteLine("Press any key to start the server!");

	Console.ReadKey();
	Console.WriteLine();

	var appServer = new AppServer();

	//Setup the appServer
	if (!appServer.Setup(2012)) //Setup with listening port
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Failed to setup!");
		Console.ReadKey();
		return;
	}

	Console.WriteLine();

	//Try to start the appServer
	if (!appServer.Start())
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Failed to start!");
		Console.ReadKey();
		return;
	}

	Console.WriteLine("The server started successfully, press key 'q' to stop it!");

	while (Console.ReadKey().KeyChar != 'q')
	{
		Console.WriteLine();
		continue;
	}

	//Stop the appServer
	appServer.Stop();

	Console.WriteLine("The server was stopped!");
	Console.ReadKey();
}
```

## Handle the Incomming Connection
1. Register new session connected event handler
	```c#
	appServer.NewSessionConnected += new SessionHandler<AppSession>(appServer_NewSessionConnected);
	```

2. Send a welcome message to client in the handler
	```c#
	static void appServer_NewSessionConnected(AppSession session)
	{
			session.Send("Welcome to SuperSocket Telnet Server");
	}
	```

3. Test by telnet client
	1. open a telnet client
	2. type "telnet localhost 2012" ending with an "ENTER"
	3. you will get the message "Welcome to SuperSocket Telnet Server"

## Process Requests
1. Register request handler
	```c#
	appServer.NewRequestReceived += new RequestHandler<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>(appServer_NewRequestReceived);
	```

2. Implement request handler
	```c#
	static void appServer_NewRequestReceived(AppSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
	{
		switch (requestInfo.Key.ToUpper())
		{
			case("ECHO"):
					session.Send(requestInfo.Body);
					break;

			case ("ADD"):
				session.Send(requestInfo.Parameters.Select(p => Convert.ToInt32(p)).Sum().ToString());
				break;

			case ("MULT"):

				var result = 1;

				foreach (var factor in requestInfo.Parameters.Select(p => Convert.ToInt32(p)))
				{
					result *= factor;
				}

				session.Send(result.ToString());
				break;
		}
	}
	```
	- requestInfo.Key is the request command line's first segment delimited by space,  requestInfo.Parameters is the left segments delimited by space

3. Test by telnet client
- You can open a telnet client to verify the above code.
- After you connect the server,  
you can interact with server in this way  
(the message after "C:" stands for client's request,  
the message after "S:" stands for server's response):
	```
	C: ECHO ABCDEF
	S: ABCDEF
	C: ADD 1 2
	S: 3
	C: ADD 250 250
	S: 500
	C: MULT 2 8
	S: 16
	C: MULT 125 2
	S: 250
	```

## Usage of Command
- In the previous part, you have seen how to deal the client's request in SuperSocket. But at the meanwhile you probably have found a problem, if you have a complex business logic in your server, the switch case would be long and urgly and actually it doens't confront with the OOD. In this case, SuperSocket provides a command framework which allow define independ classes to deal the defferent kind requests.

- For a instance, you can define a class named "ADD" to process the requests with the requestInfo's key equals "ADD":
	```c#
	public class ADD : CommandBase<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>
	{
		public override void ExecuteCommand(AppSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
		{
			session.Send(requestInfo.Parameters.Select(p => Convert.ToInt32(p)).Sum().ToString());
		}
	}
	```

- and define a class named "MULT" to process the requests with the requestInfo's key equals "MULT":
	```c#
	public class MULT : CommandBase<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>
	{
		public override void ExecuteCommand(AppSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
		{
			var result = 1;

			foreach (var factor in requestInfo.Parameters.Select(p => Convert.ToInt32(p)))
			{
					result *= factor;
			}

			session.Send(result.ToString());
		}
	}
	```

- at the same time, you also need to remove the defined reqauest handler because request handler and command cannot work together:
	```c#
	//Remove this line
	appServer.NewRequestReceived += new RequestHandler<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>(appServer_NewRequestReceived);
	```

# 3. Implement Your AppServer and AppSession
> Keywords: AppServer, AppSession

## What is AppSession?
- AppSession represents a logic socket connection, connection based operations should be defined in this class. You can use the instance of this class to send data to tcp clients, receive data from connection or close the connection.

## What is AppServer?
- AppServer stands for the server instance which listens all clients' connections, hosts all tcp connections. Ideally, we can get any session which we want to find from the AppServer. Application level operations and logics should be defined in it.

## Create your AppSession
1. You can override base AppSession's operations
	```c#
	public class TelnetSession : AppSession<TelnetSession>
	{
		protected override void OnSessionStarted()
		{
			this.Send("Welcome to SuperSocket Telnet Server");
		}

		protected override void HandleUnknownRequest(StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
		{
			this.Send("Unknow request");
		}

		protected override void HandleException(Exception e)
		{
			this.Send("Application error: {0}", e.Message);
		}

		protected override void OnSessionClosed(CloseReason reason)
		{
			//add you logics which will be executed after the session is closed
			base.OnSessionClosed(reason);
		}
	}
	```
	- In above code, the server send the welcome message to the client immediately after the session is connected. The code also overrided the other methods of AppSession to process it's own logic.

2. You can add new properties for your session according your business requirement Let me create a AppSession which would be used in a game server:
	```c#
	public class PlayerSession ï¼šAppSession<PlayerSession>
	{
		public int GameHallId { get; internal set; }

		public int RoomId { get; internal set; }
	}
	```

3. Relationship with Commands
	
	- In the first document, we talked about commands, now we revise this point here:
		```c#
		public class ECHO : CommandBase<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>
		{
			public override void ExecuteCommand(AppSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
			{
					session.Send(requestInfo.Body);
			}
		}
		```

	- In the command's code, you should have found the parent class pf ECHO is CommandBase<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>, which has a generic type parameter AppSession. Yes, it's the default AppSession. If you want to use your new AppSession, please pass your AppSession type as the parameter, or the server cannot discover the command:
		```c#
		public class ECHO : CommandBase<PlayerSession, StringRequestInfo>
		{
			public override void ExecuteCommand(PlayerSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
			{
					session.Send(requestInfo.Body);
			}
		}
		```

## Create your AppServer
1. Work with Session If you want to make available your AppSession, you must alter your AppServer to use it:
	```c#
	public class TelnetServer : AppServer<TelnetSession>
	{

	}
	```
	- Then the session TelnetSession will can be used in TelnetServer.

2. There are also many protected methods you can override
	```c#
	public class TelnetServer : AppServer<TelnetSession>
	{
			protected override bool Setup(IRootConfig rootConfig, IServerConfig config)
			{
					return base.Setup(rootConfig, config);
			}

			protected override void OnStartup()
			{
					base.OnStartup();
			}

			protected override void OnStopped()
			{
					base.OnStopped();
			}
	}
	```

## Benifits
- Imeplement your AppSession and AppServer allow you extend SuperSocket as your business requirement, you can hook session's connected and closed event, server instance's startup and stopped event. You can read your own customized configuration in AppServer's Setup() method. In summary it give you lots of abilities to build a socket server which is exact what you want very easily.

# 4. Start SuperSocket by Configuration
> Keywords: Start by Configuration, Configuration, Bootstrap, Windows Service

## Why Start Server by Configuration
1. Avoid hard coding
2. SuperSocket provides lots of useful configuration options
3. Take full use of the tools of SuperSocket

## How to Start Server by Configuration with Bootstrap
- SuperSocket configuration section SuperSocket uses .NET default configuration technology, a configuration section designed for SuperSocket:
	```xml
	<configSections>
			<section name="superSocket"
					type="SuperSocket.SocketEngine.Configuration.SocketServiceConfig, SuperSocket.SocketEngine" />
	</configSections>
	```

- Server instance configuration
	```xml
	<superSocket>
			<servers>
				<server name="TelnetServer"
						serverType="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"
						ip="Any" port="2020">
				</server>
			</servers>
	</superSocket>
	```
	- Now, I explain the configuration of server node here:
		```
		name: the name of appServer instance
		serverType: the full name of the AppServer your want to run
		ip: listen ip
		port: listen port
		```
	- We'll have the full introduction about the configuration in next document.

- Start SuperSocket using BootStrap
	```c#
	static void Main(string[] args)
	{
			Console.WriteLine("Press any key to start the server!");

			Console.ReadKey();
			Console.WriteLine();

			var bootstrap = BootstrapFactory.CreateBootstrap();

			if (!bootstrap.Initialize())
			{
					Console.WriteLine("Failed to initialize!");
					Console.ReadKey();
					return;
			}

			var result = bootstrap.Start();

			Console.WriteLine("Start result: {0}!", result);

			if (result == StartResult.Failed)
			{
					Console.WriteLine("Failed to start!");
					Console.ReadKey();
					return;
			}

			Console.WriteLine("Press key 'q' to stop it!");

			while (Console.ReadKey().KeyChar != 'q')
			{
					Console.WriteLine();
					continue;
			}

			Console.WriteLine();

			//Stop the appServer
			bootstrap.Stop();

			Console.WriteLine("The server was stopped!");
			Console.ReadKey();
	}
	```
- Some configurations samples
- Server types nodes:
	```xml
	<superSocket>
			<servers>
				<server name="TelnetServer"
						serverTypeName="TelnetServer"
						ip="Any" port="2020">
				</server>
			</servers>
			<serverTypes>
					<add name="TelnetServer" type="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"/>
			</serverTypes>
	</superSocket>
	```

- Multiple server instances:
	```xml
	<superSocket>
			<servers>
				<server name="TelnetServerA"
						serverTypeName="TelnetServer"
						ip="Any" port="2020">
				</server>
				<server name="TelnetServerB"
						serverTypeName="TelnetServer"
						ip="Any" port="2021">
				</server>
			</servers>
			<serverTypes>
					<add name="TelnetServer" type="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"/>
			</serverTypes>
	</superSocket>
	```

## SuperSocket.SocketService.exe, the Running Container provided by SuperSocket
	- Use SuperSocket.SocketService.exe directly
	- make sure all assemblies required by your server are in the same directory with SuperSocket.SocketService.exe
	- put your SuperSocket configuration node in the file SuperSocket.SocketService.exe.config
	run "SuperSocket.SocketService.exe" directly, your defined server will run
	- Install SuperSocket.SocketService.exe as windows service

- You can install SuperSocket.SocketService.exe as windows service by running it with an extra command line parameter "-i":
	```		
	SuperSocket.SocketService.exe -i
	```
- The windows service name is defined in configuration file, you can change it as your requirement:
	```xml
	<appSettings>
			<add key="ServiceName" value="SuperSocketService" />
	</appSettings>
	```

- The service also can be uninstalled by the parameter "-u":
	```
	SuperSocket.SocketService.exe -u
	```

# 5. SuperSocket Basic Configuration
> Keywords: Basic Configuration, Configuration Documentation
## A Sample Configuration
```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>

				<supportedRuntime version="v4.0" sku=".NETFramework,Version=v4.0" />
		</startup>
</configuration>
```	

## Root Configuration
- The configuration node "superSocket" is the root of the SuperSocket configuration, it defines the global parameters of SuperSocket requires. Let me explain all the attributes of the root node:
	- maxWorkingThreads: maximum working threads count of .NET thread pool;
	- minWorkingThreads: minimum working threads count of .NET thread pool;
	- maxCompletionPortThreads: maximum completion threads count of .NET thread pool;
	- minCompletionPortThreads: minimum completion threads count of .NET thread pool;
	- disablePerformanceDataCollector: whether disable performance data collector;
	- performanceDataCollectInterval: performance data collecting interval (in seconds, default value: 60);
	- isolation: SuperSocket instances isolation level
		- None - no isolation
		- AppDomain - server instances will be isolated by AppDomains
		- Process - server instances will be isolated by processes
	- logFactory: the name of default logFactory, all log factories are defined in the child node "logFactories" which will be introduced in following documentation;
	- defaultCulture: default thread culture for the global application, only available in .Net 4.5;

## Servers Configuration
- In the root configuration node, there is child node named "servers", you can define one or many server configuration nodes in it which represent app server instances. The server instances can be same AppServer type, also can be different AppServer types. All server node's attributes:
	- name: the name of the server instance;
	- serverType: the full name the AppServer's type which you want to run;
	- serverTypeName: the name of the selected server types, all server types should be defined in serverTypes node which will be introduced in following documentation;

	- clearIdleSession: true or false, whether clear idle sessions, default value is false;
	- clearIdleSessionInterval: the clearing timeout idle session interval, default value is 120, in seconds;
	- idleSessionTimeOut: The session timeout period; If the session's idle time exceeds the value, it will be closed in case of clearIdleSession is configured to be true; Default value is 300, in seconds;
	- security: Empty, Tls, Ssl3. The security option of the socket server, default value is empty;
	- maxRequestLength: The maximum allowed request length, default value is 1024;
	- textEncoding: The default text encoding in the server instance, default value is ASCII;
	- defaultCulture: default thread culture for this appserver instance, only available in .Net 4.5 and cannot be set if the isolation model is 'None';
	- disableSessionSnapshot: Indicate whether disable session snapshot, default value is false.
	- sessionSnapshotInterval: The interval of taking session snapshot, default value is 5, in seconds;
	- keepAliveTime: The interval of keeping alive, default value is 600, in seconds;
	- keepAliveInterval: The interval of retry after keep alive fail, default value is 60, in seconds;
	- certificate: it is a configuration element for X509Certificate which will be used in this server instance
	
		there are two usage:

		- one is load certificate from cert file
			```xml
			<certificate filePath="localhost.pfx" password="supersocket" />
			```
		- another one is load certificate from local certificate storage
			```xml
			<certificate storeName="My" storeLocation="LocalMachine" thumbprint="f42585bceed2cb049ef4a3c6d0ad572a6699f6f3"/>
			```
	- connectionFilter: the name of the connection filter you want to use for this server instance, multiple filters should be delimited by ',' or ';'. Connection filters should be defined in a child nodes of root node which will be introduced in the following documentation;
	- commandLoader: the name of the command loader you want to use for this server instance, multiple loaders should be delimited by ',' or ';'. Command loaders should be defined in a child nodes of root node which will be introduced in the following documentation;
	- logFactory: the log factory you want to use for this server instance. If you don't set it, the log factory defined in root configuration will be used;
	- listeners: it is an configuration element which is designed for supporting multiple listening ip/port pair in one server instance. The listeners node should contains one or more child nodes of listener whose attributes defined like below:
		```
		ip: the listening ip;
		port: the listening port;
		backlog: the listening back log size;
		security: the security mode (None/Default/Tls/Ssl/...);
		```

		for examples:
		```xml
		<server name="EchoServer" serverTypeName="EchoService">
			<listeners>
				<add ip="Any" port="2012" />
				<add ip="IPv6Any" port="2012" />
			</listeners>
		</server>
		```
	- receiveFilterFactory: the name of the receive filter factory you want to use it for this server instance;

## Server Types Configuration
- Server types node is a collection configuration node under the root. You are able to add one/more elements with element name "add" and attributes "name" and "type":
	```xml
	<serverTypes>
			<add name="TelnetServerType"
					type="SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig.TelnetServer, SuperSocket.QuickStart.TelnetServer_StartByConfig"/>
	</serverTypes>
	```
- Because of the defined server type's name is "TelnetServerType", you can set the config attribute "serverTypeName" of the server instances you want to run as this type to be "TelnetServerType":
	```xml
	<server name="TelnetServerA"
					serverTypeName="TelnetServerType"
					ip="Any"
					port="2020">
	</server>
	```

## Log Factories Configuration
- Same as server type configuration, you also can define one or more log factories and use it in server, the only one difference is the log factory also can be set in root configuration:
	```xml
	<logFactories>
		<add name="ConsoleLogFactory"
				type="SuperSocket.SocketBase.Logging.ConsoleLogFactory, SuperSocket.SocketBase" />
	</logFactories>
	```
- Use it in root configuration:
	```xml
	<superSocket logFactory="ConsoleLogFactory">
			...
			...
	</superSocket>
	```
- Use it in server node:
	```xml
	<server name="TelnetServerA"
				logFactory="ConsoleLogFactory"
				ip="Any"
				port="2020">
	</server>
	```

## Configuration Intellisense
- SuperSocket provides online XSD (XML Schema Document) file to help your configuration. You just need to add 3 extra lines in your SuperSocket configuration section:
	```xml
	<superSocket xmlns="http://schema.supersocket.net/supersocket"
							xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
							xsi:schemaLocation="http://schema.supersocket.net/supersocket http://schema.supersocket.net/v1-6/supersocket.xsd">
		<!---->
	</superSocket>
	```
- Then you will get the intelligent auto completion function when you update the configuration:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kerryjiang/SuperSocket.Document/v1.6/images/configinteli.jpg)

## SuperSocket Windows Service Configuration
- As you know, SuperSocket provides a running container "SuperSocket.SocketService.exe" which can run as a windows service.

- You can define the windows service's name by configuring:
	```xml
	<appSettings>
			<add key="ServiceName" value="SuperSocketService" />
	</appSettings>
	```

- There are some other configuration attributes for the windows service:
	```
	- ServiceDescription: the description of this windows service
	- ServicesDependedOn: the other windows service which this service depends on; this windows service will start after the depended windows service; multiple depended service should be separated by character ',' or ';'
	```

# 6. The Built-in Command Line Protocol
> Keywords: Command Line, Protocol, StringRequestInfo, Text Encoding
## What's the Protocol?
What's the Protocol? Lots of people probably will answer "TCP" or "UDP". But to build a network application, only TCP or UDP is not enough. TCP and UDP are transport-layer protocols. It's far from enough to enable talking between two endpoints in the network if you only define transport-layer protocol. You need to define your application level protocol to convert your received binary data to the requests which your application can understand.

## The Built-in Command Line Protocol
- The command line protocol is a widely used protocols, lots of protocols like Telnet, SMTP, POP3 and FTP protocols are base on command line protocol etc. If you do not have a custom protocol, then SuperSocket will use command line protocol by default, which can simplify the development of this kind of protocols.

- The command line protocol defines each request must be ended with a carriage return "\r\n".

- If you use the command line protocol in SuperSocket, all requests will to translated into StringRequestInfo instances.

- StringRequestInfo is defined like this:
	```c#
	public class StringRequestInfo
	{
			public string Key { get; }

			public string Body { get; }

			public string[] Parameters { get; }

			/*
			Other properties and methods
			*/
	}
	```

- Because the built-in command line protocol in SuperSocket uses a space to split request key and parameters, So when the client sends the data below to the server:
	```
	"LOGIN kerry 123456" + NewLine
	```
- the SuperSocket server will receive a StringRequestInfo instance, the properties of the request info instance will be:
	```
	Key: "LOGIN"
	Body: "kerry 123456";
	Parameters: ["kerry", "123456"]
	```

- If you have defined a Command with name "LOGIN", the command's ExecuteCommand method will be excuted with the StringRequestInfo instance as parameter:
	```c#
	public class LOGIN : CommandBase<AppSession, StringRequestInfo>
	{
			public override void ExecuteCommand(AppSession session, StringRequestInfo requestInfo)
			{
					//Implement your business logic
			}
	}
	```

## Customize the Command Line Protocol
- Some users might have different request format, for instance:
	```
	"LOGIN:kerry,12345" + NewLine
	```

- The request's key is separated with body by the char ':', and the parameters are separated by the char ','. This kind of request can be supported easily, just extend the command line protocol like the below code:
	```c#
	public class YourServer : AppServer<YourSession>
	{
			public YourServer()
					: base(new CommandLineReceiveFilterFactory(Encoding.Default, new BasicRequestInfoParser(":", ",")))
			{

			}
	}
	```

- If you want to customize the request format much deeper, you can implement a RequestInfoParser class base the interface IRequestInfoParser, and then pass in your own RequestInfoParser instance when instantiate the CommandLineReceiveFilterFactory instance:
	```c#
	public class YourServer : AppServer<YourSession>
	{
			public YourServer()
					: base(new CommandLineReceiveFilterFactory(Encoding.Default, new YourRequestInfoParser()))
			{

			}
	}
	```

## Text Encoding
- The default encoding of the command line protocol is Ascii, but you can change it in the configuration by setting the "textEncoding" attribute of the server node:

# 7. The Built-in Common Format Protocol Implementation Templates
> Keywords: Protocol Tools, Custom Protocol, TerminatorReceiveFilter, CountSpliterReceiveFilter, FixedSizeReceiveFilter, BeginEndMarkReceiveFilter, FixedHeaderReceiveFilter

- After reading the previous document, you probably find implementing your own protocol using SuperSocket is not easy for you. To make this job easier, SuperSocket provides some common protocol tools, which you can use to build your own protocol easily and fast:

	- TerminatorReceiveFilter (SuperSocket.SocketBase.Protocol.TerminatorReceiveFilter, SuperSocket.SocketBase)
	- CountSpliterReceiveFilter (SuperSocket.Facility.Protocol.CountSpliterReceiveFilter, SuperSocket.Facility)
	- FixedSizeReceiveFilter (SuperSocket.Facility.Protocol.FixedSizeReceiveFilter, SuperSocket.Facility)
	- BeginEndMarkReceiveFilter (SuperSocket.Facility.Protocol.BeginEndMarkReceiveFilter, SuperSocket.Facility)
	- FixedHeaderReceiveFilter (SuperSocket.Facility.Protocol.FixedHeaderReceiveFilter, SuperSocket.Facility)

## TerminatorReceiveFilter - Terminator Protocol
- Similar with command line protocol, some protocols use a terminator to identify a request. For example, one protocol uses two chars "##" as terminator, then you can use the class "TerminatorReceiveFilterFactory":
	```c#
	/// <summary>
	/// TerminatorProtocolServer
	/// Each request end with the terminator "##"
	/// ECHO Your message##
	/// </summary>
	public class TerminatorProtocolServer : AppServer
	{
			public TerminatorProtocolServer()
					: base(new TerminatorReceiveFilterFactory("##"))
			{

			}
	}

	```

- The default RequestInfo is StringRequestInfo, you also can create your own RequestInfo class, but it requires a bit more work:

- Implement your ReceiveFilter base on TerminatorReceiveFilter:
	```c#
	public class YourReceiveFilter : TerminatorReceiveFilter<YourRequestInfo>
	{
			//More code
	}
	```

- Implement your ReceiveFilterFactory which can create your request filter instances:
	```c#
	public class YourReceiveFilterFactory : IReceiveFilterFactory<YourRequestInfo>
	{
			//More code
	}
	```
- And then use the request filter factory in your AppServer.

## CountSpliterReceiveFilter - Fixed Number Split Parts with Separator Protocol
- Some protocols defines their requests look like in the format of "#part1#part2#part3#part4#part5#part6#part7#". There are 7 parts in one request and all parts are separated by char '#'. This kind protocol's implementing also is quite easy:
	```c#
	/// <summary>
	/// Your protocol likes like the format below:
	/// #part1#part2#part3#part4#part5#part6#part7#
	/// </summary>
	public class CountSpliterAppServer : AppServer
	{
			public CountSpliterAppServer()
					: base(new CountSpliterReceiveFilterFactory((byte)'#', 8)) // 7 parts but 8 separators
			{

			}
	}
	```

- You also can customize your protocol deeper using the classes below:
	```
	CountSpliterReceiveFilter<TRequestInfo>
	CountSpliterReceiveFilterFactory<TReceiveFilter>
	CountSpliterReceiveFilterFactory<TReceiveFilter, TRequestInfo>

	```
## FixedSizeReceiveFilter - Fixed Size Request Protocol
- In this kind protocol, the size of all requests are same. If your each request is 9 characters string like "KILL BILL", what you should do is implementing a ReceiveFilter like the code below:
	```c#
	class MyReceiveFilter : FixedSizeReceiveFilter<StringRequestInfo>
	{
			public MyReceiveFilter()
					: base(9) //pass in the fixed request size
			{

			}

			protected override StringRequestInfo ProcessMatchedRequest(byte[] buffer, int offset, int length, bool toBeCopied)
			{
					//TODO: construct the request info instance from the parsed data and then return
			}
	}
	```

- Then use the receive filter in your AppServer class:
	```c#
	public class MyAppServer : AppServer
	{
			public MyAppServer()
					: base(new DefaultReceiveFilterFactory<MyReceiveFilter, StringRequestInfo>()) //using default receive filter factory
			{

			}
	}
	```

## BeginEndMarkReceiveFilter - The Protocol with Begin and End Mark
- Every message in this protocol have fixed begin mark and end mark. For example, I have a protocol all messages are in the format "!xxxxxxxxxxxxxx$". In this case "!" is begin mark and the "$" is end mark, so my receive filter looks like:
	```c#
	class MyReceiveFilter : BeginEndMarkReceiveFilter<StringRequestInfo>
	{
		//Both begin mark and end mark can be two or more bytes
		private readonly static byte[] BeginMark = new byte[] { (byte)'!' };
		private readonly static byte[] EndMark = new byte[] { (byte)'$' };

		public MyReceiveFilter()
				: base(BeginMark, EndMark) //pass in the begin mark and end mark
		{

		}

		protected override StringRequestInfo ProcessMatchedRequest(byte[] readBuffer, int offset, int length)
		{
				//TODO: construct the request info instance from the parsed data and then return
		}
	}
	```
	
- Then use the receive filter in your AppServer class:
	```c#
	public class MyAppServer : AppServer
	{
		public MyAppServer()
				: base(new DefaultReceiveFilterFactory<MyReceiveFilter, StringRequestInfo>()) //using default receive filter factory
		{

		}
	}
	```

## FixedHeaderReceiveFilter - Fixed Header with Body Length Protocol
- This kind protocol defines each request has two parts, the first part contains some basic information of this request include the length of the second part. We usually call the first part is header and the second part is body.

- For example, we have a protocol like that: the header contains 6 bytes, the first 4 bytes represent the request's name, the last 2 bytes represent the length of the body:

		/// +-------+---+-------------------------------+
		/// |request| l |                               |
		/// | name  | e |    request body               |
		/// |  (4)  | n |                               |
		/// |       |(2)|                               |
		/// +-------+---+-------------------------------+

- Using SuperSocket, you can implement this kind protocol easily:
	```c#
	class MyReceiveFilter : FixedHeaderReceiveFilter<BinaryRequestInfo>
	{
		public MyReceiveFilter()
				: base(6)
		{

		}

		protected override int GetBodyLengthFromHeader(byte[] header, int offset, int length)
		{
				return (int)header[offset + 4] * 256 + (int)header[offset + 5];
		}

		protected override BinaryRequestInfo ResolveRequestInfo(ArraySegment<byte> header, byte[] bodyBuffer, int offset, int length)
		{
				return new BinaryRequestInfo(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(header.Array, header.Offset, 4), bodyBuffer.CloneRange(offset, length));
		}
	}
	```

- You need to implement your own request filter base on FixedHeaderReceiveFilter.
	- The number 6 passed into the parent class's constructor means the size of the request header;
	- The method "GetBodyLengthFromHeader(...)" you should override returns the length of the body according the received header;
	- the method "ResolveRequestInfo(....)" you should override returns the RequestInfo instance according the received header and body.
- Then you can build a receive filter factory or use the default receive factory to use this receive filter in SuperSocket.
